"A score of 4 is outstanding and demonstrates a rich content with insightful analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, along with clear connections to real-life situations. A score of 3 is proficient, indicating substantial information with evidence of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, although the connections made are sometimes unclear or too obvious. A score of 2 is basic, showing limited connections and thin information with poor attempts at analysis and synthesis, and a vague and off-topic material. A score of 1 is below expectation, with superficial, rudimentary analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, limited connection to real-life situations, and off-topic",We went on round with consultants we could see what we were being taught in class. Theory was applicable. Skills were enhanced through the clinical experience and the nurses were very helpful. The current methodology we do during rotations is working in enhancing our skills and it is important to be hands on during rotations. Patients are so patient with students.,1,2,"Based on the scoring rubric, the text would score a 2.
While the text provides some information about clinical experience and the importance of being hands-on during rotations, there is a lack of critical thinking demonstrated. The text contains limited connections to real-life situations and lacks analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The statements made are vague and lack specificity or evidence to support them. Additionally, the statement about patients being patient with students is a generalization without any further elaboration or explanation.
To improve the score, the author could provide more detailed examples or evidence to support their claims and provide a deeper analysis of their experiences during clinical rotations. They could also provide specific ways in which their skills were enhanced and how this will benefit them in their future careers. Finally, they could make connections between their experiences and broader healthcare issues or policies.",3,"I would score the essay a 3.

Overall, the essay is a good example of critical thinking. The student is able to analyze and synthesize the information presented, and they are able to evaluate the information critically. Additionally, the student makes clear connections to real-life situations and adds personal experiences or reflections that add depth to the essay.
However, the essay could be improved by providing more specific examples of how the student applied their knowledge and skills in the clinical setting. For example, the student could discuss a specific patient encounter and how they were able to use their knowledge and skills to provide the patient with the best possible care. Additionally, the student could provide more specific examples of how they were able to overcome the challenges they faced. For example, the student could discuss how they were able to overcome their fear of speaking to patients.

It had clear connections made to real-life situations as well as the ability of showing how theory is applicable while skills were enhanced through clinical experience with helpful nurses being very hands on during rotations which allows patients' patience towards students.
",2,"Based on the rubric provided, I would assign a score of 2 to this essay. The reason is that while the author mentions some benefits of going on rounds with consultants, applying theory, enhancing skills, getting assistance from nurses, and appreciating the importance of hands-on training during rotations, the text is short and lacks depth and specific details. Moreover, the statements are quite generalized, leaving many questions unanswered about how exactly the experience improved the author's understanding of the subject matter, the nature of challenges faced or lessons learned during practical sessions. Overall it can be seen that essay shows limited connection with the material and only touches upon few key points, with little elaboration. "
,Clinical rotations form an important part of learning as you can put into practice content taught in class. The rotations put into perspective what happens in the reality which will help us when we treat patients in real life. I enjoyed the rotations and look forward to other rotations to follow. This has provided me with the strength to continue my medical journey which I know will not be easy but I am prepared to continue working hard. I intend to make the best of the opportunities provided to me to ensure I become the best doctor I can be. It was important to visit the three hospitals where we did the rotations.,2,3,"I would score this essay a 3.

While the writer mentions learning from clinical rotations by putting theory into practice and gaining exposure to real-world scenarios, they don't go much further in terms of analyzing or evaluating the situation, except to say that it gives them confidence and preparation for future studies."
,"I learnt a lot from the nurses and even though one of the encounters with a nurse was not pleasant, I understood the stressful environment in which the nurses work and it was an opportunity for me to see what is required of us in terms of skills and the speed at which we have to respond. Not a pleasant moment but a learning moment. I realized that I was more comfortable to assist when I was in a group with friends. This made me realize that I need to get used to working in an environment where I am not surrounded by the people I know. I was very timid in a set up without my friends. I need to work on this. The exposure to clinical procedures exceeded my expectations. I observed my first natural vaginal delivery, a tubal ligation, did an examination on a new-born and a placenta examination. I used the opportunity to practice my communication skills and spoke to a mother who had a new baby. I want to be exposed to more patients and more procedures, I know this will allow me to build the confidence I need to continue growing.

I also learned a lot about the different types of clinical procedures that nurses perform, and I got to observe some of these procedures firsthand.
The exposure to clinical procedures exceeded my expectations. I was able to observe my first natural vaginal delivery, a tubal ligation, and an examination on a new-born.

,"In a specific hospital a nurse explained the entire post-delivery care, and placental examination step by step. The nurse lectured us on content I realized I need to spend time to revise. In that moment I decided that I would be that kind of health care professional who takes the time to make a difference to people who are learning. I appreciated her efforts because I could see other healthcare professionals did not share the same character as this nurse. Since I seized every opportunity to learn, I jumped in to assist even though I did not have all the answers. I was afraid but I decided to participate afraid than to do nothing at all. After each rotation I reflected on the procedures observed and I how I responded. I then jotted down a few notes to myself on the areas I need to improve and extra hours I need to spend in the skills lab to improve specific skills. I will practice all these skills before I move to the next Block, incase there is no time. A friend and I committed to unwind and share our emotional experiences after each rotation. This allowed us the opportunity to share and to heal from some of the traumatic experiences we had.",4,3,"Based on the scoring rubric, I would score this essay a 3.

Here is an example of how the student could improve their essay:
""I was fortunate to have a nurse who took the time to explain the entire post-delivery care and placental examination step by step. She lectured us on content that I realized I needed to spend time to revise. In that moment, I decided that I would be that kind of healthcare professional who takes the time to make a difference to people who are learning. I appreciated her efforts because I could see that other healthcare professionals did not share the same character as this nurse.
One example of how other healthcare professionals were different was that they were not as patient or understanding. They were often short-tempered and impatient, and they did not take the time to explain things to patients or their families. This was in contrast to the nurse who had explained the post-delivery care and placental examination to me. She was patient and understanding, and she took the time to explain things to me in a way that I could understand.
My experiences in clinical rotations have helped me to grow as a healthcare professional in a number of ways. First, they have helped me to develop my clinical skills. I have had the opportunity to observe and participate in a variety of clinical procedures, which has helped me to develop my skills and knowledge. Second, my clinical rotations have helped me to develop my communication skills. I have had to interact with patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals, which has helped me to develop my communication skills. Third, my clinical rotations have helped me to develop my empathy and compassion. I have seen the impact that healthcare can have on people's lives, and this has helped me to develop my empathy and compassion.
I am grateful for the opportunity to have had clinical rotations, and I know that they will help me to be a better healthcare professional in the future.""",,,3,"Based on the given rubric, I would give this essay a rating of 3 out of 4.
