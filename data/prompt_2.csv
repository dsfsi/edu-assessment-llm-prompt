Essay1: My clinical experience in this block was very insightful. This block has been a very pleasent welcome into what the clinical setting is like for the Med student. I came across a wide variety of Doctors and allied health practitioners in terms of approach to teaching. Skill improvement to me meant that I should do my best to get my hands busy, whilst allowing room to other students to also develop should they wish to. This is something I look to take into my stride going forward in this journey. I realised that sometimes being at the hospital only for the allocated time may not be sufficent to exposure of certain elements. I may be required to stay beyond the allocated time scope and this is something I will be prepared to do. A: This essay is below the level of expectation, it has bad language, there is little analysis, and no synthesis, and it is superficial and lacks connection, therefore the score of this essay is 1.
 Essay2: The rotations somewhat met my expectations, I knew that we would be very hands on with the patients but i did not expect to be that independent in the hospital. I also was not expecting how helpful the SIC's and intern doctors were going to be. We met a few of them who allowed us to do a few rounds with them and examine patients and practice some of our skills whilst eductating us on normal phyiosolgy, pathophysiology and treatemts. I definetely did not expect that. There was a specifc intern who allowed me and a fellow classmate to practice our examination skills while he supervisd and corrected us whenever we did anthing incorrectly. It was very helpful and i feel a lot more confident in my skills. I have also watched a few online videons on examinations to further improve my examination skills. The intern also helped us with our investigation skills and so did the HIV counselling section of the rotations.  A: This essay is basic, is basic, showing limited connections and thin information with poor attempts at analysis and synthesis, and a vague and off-topic material, therefore the score is 2.

Essay3 :Starting my first ever clinical rotation was stressful. I didn’t know what to expect, but now that it’s my final day I am happy with how things turned out. Rotations gave me another perspective of what the medical field is all about, the stress, the happiness, the heart break and the confidence needed to strive. I got to meet amazing nurses and doctors that inspired me even more to aim to be the best doctor that I can be. They were eager to help and teach us stuff you can’t always learn through theory. Best part would be the fact that I got to experience the beauty of life. Working with new born babies was the highlight of my day. Having to hold them and learn how different they are from us. I was so scared to hold the babies at first, thinking that I will hurt them if I press too hard or that they’ll start crying and I wouldn’t know what to do, but I learned that if you’re calm they’ll be calm too. I got to experience what it was like working with different people from different backgrounds and personalities and how to adapt to each individual case. I will definitely be more comfortable working with expecting mothers and babies in the future. I got to improve my skills through constant practice. I now know how to correctly measure the SFH and how to look for the fetal heart rate. I will be able to spot any basic danger signs. In future I need to work on my confidence in what I do because I know I am capable of doing anything. I also want to work more on drawing blood. But overall it was an amazing experience and it made me excited (but also still really scared) for what is still to come.  A: This essay is Proficient, it shows substantial information with evidence of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, although the connections made are sometimes unclear or too obvious, therefore this essay is given a score of 3.
 Essay4: Who am I? I almost giggled when I saw this question in our study guide- as if it isn’t a question I ask myself multiple times a day. As if it is a question I actually have a coherent answer to. I have a few ingrained core qualities and morals that have been with me throughout my life, and which I’m pretty sure will stay with me for the rest of it. But as I’m still young, I like to think of myself as constantly changing and evolving, and not as someone that’s stuck in a rigid framework of beliefs, personality traits and rules. I try to always leave room for growth. So even though I’m not entirely sure who I am yet, I do know this: I am kind, I am open-minded, I listen and observe intently and I have a deep care and empathy for people who need help. These are my core qualities, and they will be the centre of my life as a doctor. I am honestly torn about how I feel about the upcoming clinical rotations. On the one hand, I am beside myself with excitement, because this is the moment I’ve been waiting for for what feels like my whole life- being in a hospital and helping people and working with real patients. I know that I will see more and learn more than I have ever dreamed possible at this age. But I am also terrified- do I know enough? Will I be able to help in an emergency situation or will I freeze? Do I have the social skills to work with patients and doctors? Can I handle the emotions that come with the practical work? My current medical practical skill set is limited. I have drawn blood and put in IV lines and stitches a few times, but I am not yet comfortable with these procedures. I will improve upon this by asking questions, and observing and trying as much as possible, as I know that this is the only way I can learn. Even though I do not yet know all of the theory and practical skills that being a doctor requires, I always remember these words from one of our lecturers: “There are more mistakes made by people who do not care, than by people who do not know.” I might not know everything, but I always, always care.A: this is outstanding and demonstrates a rich content with insightful analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, along with clear connections to real-life situations,therefore this essay is given a score of 4. 
Now score this new essay using the rubric and the examples:


",Clinical rotations form an important part of learning as you can put into practice content taught in class. The rotations put into perspective what happens in the reality which will help us when we treat patients in real life. I enjoyed the rotations and look forward to other rotations to follow. This has provided me with the strength to continue my medical journey which I know will not be easy but I am prepared to continue working hard. I intend to make the best of the opportunities provided to me to ensure I become the best doctor I can be. It was important to visit the three hospitals where we did the rotations.,2,2,"Based on the rubric provided, the essay seems to be lacking in content, analysis, and evaluation. It only provides a basic understanding of the importance of clinical rotations without any specific examples or evidence to support the claims made. Therefore, the essay can be assigned a score of 2, which indicates a basic level of writing with limited connections and thin information, poor attempts at analysis and synthesis, and vague and off-topic material.",3,"I would score the essay a 3. The essay demonstrates substantial information with evidence of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, although the connections made are sometimes unclear or too obvious.  The essay begins by stating that clinical rotations are an important part of learning as they allow students to put into practice the content that is taught in class. The author then goes on to say that the rotations put into perspective what happens in reality, which will help students when they treat patients in real life. The author also expresses their enjoyment of the rotations and their excitement for the upcoming rotations.

Overall, the essay is a good start, but it could be improved by providing more detail and evidence to support the student's claims.
Here are some additional details and evidence that the student could provide:
Specific examples of how clinical rotations have helped the student learn and grow.
Specific examples of how clinical rotations have helped the student put into practice what they have learned in class.
Specific examples of how clinical rotations have helped the student understand the reality of being a doctor.

,"We went on round with consultants we could see what we were being taught in class. Theory was
applicable. Skills were enhanced through the clinical experience and the nurses were very helpful.
The current methodology we do during rotations is working in enhancing our skills and it is important
to be hands on during rotations. Patients are so patient with students.",1,1,"Based on the rubric provided, the essay in the new prompt appears to be similar to the first example essay, which was assigned a score of 1. The language used is poor, and there is no analysis, synthesis, or evaluation of the experiences described. Additionally, the content is superficial and lacks connections to real-life situations. Therefore, the score for this new essay would also be 1.",2,"I would score the essay a 2.

,"I learnt a lot from the nurses and even though one of the encounters with a nurse was not pleasant, I
understood the stressful environment in which the nurses work and it was an opportunity for me to
see what is required of us in terms of skills and the speed at which we have to respond. Not a
pleasant moment but a learning moment. I realized that I was more comfortable to assist when I was
in a group with friends. This made me realize that I need to get used to working in an environment
where I am not surrounded by the people I know. I was very timid in a set up without my friends. I
need to work on this. The exposure to clinical procedures exceeded my expectations. I observed my
first natural vaginal delivery, a tubal ligation, did an examination on a new-born and a placenta
examination. I used the opportunity to practice my communication skills and spoke to a mother who
had a new baby. I want to be exposed to more patients and more procedures, I know this will allow
me to build the confidence I need to continue growing.",3,3,"Based on the provided rubric, I would score this text a 3.
The essay provides substantial information about the author's experience during their clinical rotations, including encounters with nurses, observations of clinical procedures, and reflections on their own personal growth. The author also shows evidence of analysis and synthesis by reflecting on their own behavior and attitudes in response to different situations.
While there are some connections made to real-life situations, they are not particularly insightful or unique. The essay could benefit from more specific examples or details to support the author's reflections. Nonetheless, the author demonstrates a clear understanding of the subject content and shows a personal connection to their own life and growth.

,"In a specific hospital a nurse explained the entire post-delivery care, and placental examination step
by step. The nurse lectured us on content I realized I need to spend time to revise. In that moment I
decided that I would be that kind of health care professional who takes the time to make a difference
to people who are learning. I appreciated her efforts because I could see other healthcare
professionals did not share the same character as this nurse. Since I seized every opportunity to
learn, I jumped in to assist even though I did not have all the answers. I was afraid but I decided to

participate afraid than to do nothing at all. After each rotation I reflected on the procedures observed
and I how I responded. I then jotted down a few notes to myself on the areas I need to improve and
extra hours I need to spend in the skills lab to improve specific skills. I will practice all these skills
before I move to the next Block, incase there is no time. A friend and I committed to unwind and share
our emotional experiences after each rotation. This allowed us the opportunity to share and to heal
from some of the traumatic experiences we had.",4,4,"Based on the information provided in the previous question, the new essay can be assigned a score of 4. The essay demonstrates a rich content with insightful analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, along with clear connections to real-life situations. The essay also includes a personal reflection and a commitment to self-improvement, which shows a deeper level of critical thinking.",3,"I would give this essay a 3.
The essay is well-written and organized, and the student clearly has a good understanding of the material. The student is able to analyze and synthesize the information presented, and they are able to evaluate the information critically. Additionally, the student makes some connections to real-life situations.
However, the essay does not provide enough detail or evidence to support the student's claims. For example, the student states that ""the nurse lectured us on content I realized I need to spend time to revise,"" but they do not provide any specific examples of what they learned. Additionally, the student states that ""other healthcare professionals did not share the same character as this nurse,"" but they do not provide any specific examples of how other healthcare professionals were different.
Overall, the essay is a good start, but it could be improved by providing more detail and evidence to support the student's claims.
Here are some additional details and evidence that the student could provide:
Specific examples of what the student learned from the nurse's lecture.
Specific examples of how other healthcare professionals were different from the nurse.
Specific examples of how the student's experiences have helped them to grow as a healthcare professional.
By providing more detail and evidence, the student would be able to strengthen their argument and make their essay more persuasive.
Here is an example of how the student could improve their essay:
""I was fortunate to have a nurse who took the time to explain the entire post-delivery care and placental examination step by step. She lectured us on content that I realized I needed to spend time to revise. In that moment, I decided that I would be that kind of healthcare professional who takes the time to make a difference to people who are learning. I appreciated her efforts because I could see that other healthcare professionals did not share the same character as this nurse.
One example of how other healthcare professionals were different was that they were not as patient or understanding. They were often short-tempered and impatient, and they did not take the time to explain things to patients or their families. This was in contrast to the nurse who had explained the post-delivery care and placental examination to me. She was patient and understanding, and she took the time to explain things to me in a way that I could understand.
My experiences in clinical rotations have helped me to grow as a healthcare professional in a number of ways. First, they have helped me to develop my clinical skills. I have had the opportunity to observe and participate in a variety of clinical procedures, which has helped me to develop my skills and knowledge. Second, my clinical rotations have helped me to develop my communication skills. I have had to interact with patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals, which has helped me to develop my communication skills. Third, my clinical rotations have helped me to develop my empathy and compassion. I have seen the impact that healthcare can have on people's lives, and this has helped me to develop my empathy and compassion.
I am grateful for the opportunity to have had clinical rotations, and I know that they will help me to be a better healthcare professional in the future.""",,
